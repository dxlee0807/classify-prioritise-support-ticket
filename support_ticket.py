# expected file: 
# - tuned_lr.pkl, 
# - [topic_lda, topic_lda.id2word] to get topic information (actually need turn it into df and load)

# Financial Domain Complaint Ticketing System

# try using generative AI to generate some (3-5) financial complaint tickets

# enter title [short_text]
# enter description [long_text]

# preprocess the description
